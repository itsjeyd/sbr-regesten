\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This documentation accompanies work that was carried out over the
course of nine months by Susanne Fertmann, Tim Krones, and Conrad
Steffens for the Software Project ``Computerlinguistische Aufarbeitung
kulturhistorischer Dokumente'', under supervision of
Prof.~Dr.~Caroline Sporleder. The project targets the book
\href{http://universaar.uni-saarland.de/monographien/volltexte/2012/82/pdf/regesten.pdf}{``Regesten
  zur Geschichte der Stadt Saarbr端cken (bis 1545)''} by Irmtraut
Eder-Stein, which is a collection of historical deeds
(\emph{Urkunden}) pertaining to the history of the city of
Saarbr端cken.\footnote{Hanns Klein/Irmtraud Eder-Stein, Regesten zur
  Geschichte der Stadt Saarbr端cken (bis 1545), universaar, Saarbr端cken
  2012.} Throughout this documentation, we will refer to this work
simply as \emph{Sbr-Regesten}. When referring to individual deeds, we
will use the term \emph{regest}.

The main goal of the project was to come up with a digital
representation of the book in order to lay the foundation for making
the information contained in the original text easily searchable, as
well as for extracting different kinds of implicit knowledge from it.

To achieve this goal, the following (sub-)tasks were identified and
completed within the scope of the project:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Design a custom \emph{XML schema} for the Sbr-Regesten using the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)}{XML Schema
    Definition Language (XSD)}.
\item Extract all information contained in the original text and
  annotate it according to this schema.
\item Create a \emph{database schema} based on the XML schema.
\item Store the information extracted from the Sbr-Regesten in a
  database created from this schema.
\item As a first step towards making the contents of the Sbr-Regesten
  available to a wider audience, set up a \emph{web application} on
  top of the database that allows users with administrative rights to
  browse, add, modify, and delete database content.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this document is structured as follows: Chapter
\ref{sec:overview} provides an overview of the different components
that were implemented for the purpose of extracting, annotating, and
storing information contained in the Sbr-Regesten, and how they are
chained to form a full \emph{extraction pipeline}. Chapters
\ref{sec:regesten} and \ref{sec:index} provide a detailed account of
the XML schema and extraction logic for the ``Regesten'' and ``Index''
chapters of the Sbr-Regesten. Chapter \ref{sec:other} explains the XML
mark-up for the remaining parts of the book, and how they were
extracted from the original text. The last chapter focuses on the web
application, providing general information about the
\href{https://www.djangoproject.com/}{Django Web Application
  Framework}, as well detailed guidance for installing, running,
using, deploying and extending the application. It also includes
information about the data model the web application is based on.

Chapter \ref{sec:index} was written by Susanne Fertmann, and Chapter
\ref{sec:webapp} was written by Tim Krones. Chapter
\ref{sec:regesten}, as well as sections \ref{sec:preface} and
\ref{sec:archives}, will be supplied by Conrad Steffens at a later
date. The remaining chapters represent a joint effort between Susanne
Fertmann and Tim Krones.
