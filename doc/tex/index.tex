The index is a manually build list of entities that appear in the
regests. It is the last part of the Sbr-Regesten and is 277 pages
long. Figure~\ref{fig:index-examples} shows typical index entries
taken from the Sbr-Regesten. The index entries differ from each other,
but can roughly be divided into the following five groups:
\textit{locations, landmarks, persons, families} and
\textit{persongroups}. In total, there are 1035 index entries (see
Figure~\ref{fig:type-table} for the distribution of groups).

\subsection{Index Entries}
An index entry can intuitively be divided into two parts, which we
name \textit{header} and \textit{body}. The header gives more details
about the entity, e.g. where a location is located, what profession a
person has or in which regest to find the entity. The body gives a
list of concepts/entities which are in some (sometimes specified)
relation to the index entity. For example \textit{Boos von Waldeck}
(see Figure~\ref{fig:index-examples}) would have the header
\textit{Boos von Waldeck, Familie von 1473-03-19}. The remaining part
of the index entry would be the body.

Irrespective of the group they belong to, index entries have some
elements in common. Each index entry starts with its name, which is
written in bold. The name might be followed by alternative or
additional names. These are usually written in italics (which
indicates that they are original text) and in parenthesis right after
the name. The header of index entries usually ends with a set of
numbers in the form of dates, which refer to the particular regests,
where this entity is named. Right after these regest-references, there
might appear references to other index entities. They start with the
word \textit{siehe} (\textit{see}).

The body of an index entry is a list of concepts, which are related to
the entity. For example \textit{Karl} stands in some relation to the
family \textit{Boos von Waldeck}, namely he is a member of it. There
exist different layers of such related concepts. If \textit{Karl} had
a son for example, he could appear indented below \textit{Karl}. But
apparently, a concept on the third level must not obligatorily be in
relation with the one the first level. The house where Karl lived
could appear below \textit{Karl} as well, although it is not directly
related to the family. Often, the authors manually introduced a level
between the index entity and the actual body-entities/concepts in
order to group the items. For example \textit{Einwohner} or
\textit{Güter}, below which there can be found a list of
inhabitants/goods which in the regests appeared in relation with the
index entity. Each concept might be followed by a set of numbers,
which refers the reader to the regest in which the concept was named.

Apart from these commonalities, the headers and bodies are distinct
for the different groups. The following sections describe the
distinctive parts each of the five groups.

  index}
\label{fig:location-list}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Locations}
The locations found in the index are geographical or political. They
might also be buildings. Among them are towns, castles, parishes,
kingdoms or mills. A full list of the types of locations found in the
index can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:location-list}. In the index
entry, the type of location is usually specified right after the name
or eventual additional names. It is often followed by district
(Gemeinde, Stadt, Stadtverband, Kreis), region (Province, Bundesland
or Departement) and/or country. Most of the locations are in Germany.
The country is only specified, when the location is not in Germany.
Sometimes additional descriptions of where to find the location can be
found right after the type name (e.g. \textit{Dorf im Köllertal},
\textit{Hof bei St. Ingbert}). Locations also specify if a location is
no longer inhabited. Entries of such abandoned villages
(\textit{Wüstungen}) contain references where to find them in Staerk's
catalogue\footnote{Dieter Staerk, Die Wüstungen des Saarlandes,
  Minerva-Verlag, Saarbrücken,
  1974.}). %See figure~\ref{fig:location-example} for sample entries.

    Sbr-Regesten}
  \label{fig:location-example}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Landmarks}
Landmarks (\textit{Flurnamen}) are geographical units as forests,
mountains, valleys. For the whole list of landmarks found in the
index, see Figure~\ref{fig:location-list}. Landmarks do not provide
any additional unique
information.% See figure~\ref{fig:landmark-example} for sample entries.

  \caption{Examples for landmark index entries taken from the
    Sbr-Regesten}
  \label{fig:landmark-example}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Persons}
Person-headers may contain forenames, surnames, maiden names any
generational names (as \textit{Senior, the first, II.}). Additionally
they can specify the role or occupation of the person, biographical
information such as date of birth or date of the beginning the role
and relations to other persons (e.g. \textit{married with, son
  of}).% See figure~\ref{fig:person-example} for sample entries.

  \caption{Examples for person index entries taken from the
    Sbr-Regesten}
  \label{fig:person-example}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Families}
Family-headers have no special elements. But their body can be defined
more precisely. Family-bodies do not only represent a list of related
entities/concepts, but they are a list of the members of the family.
After each of them, the regest where it appeared might be specified.
Below each family member (at the next level) there might appear
concepts related to that specific member. This might again be a family
member but not necessarily.
%%See figure~\ref{fig:family-example} for sample entries.

  \caption{Examples for family index entries taken from the
    Sbr-Regesten}
  \label{fig:family-example}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Persongroups}
Persongroups are index entries that contain a group of persons. For
example, there is a list for popes, for inhabitants of Saarbrücken,
bishops etc. The complete list is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:location-list}. The group name is specified in the
header. Similar to the families, the header does not contain any
specific elements, whereas the body is a list of concepts which can be
specified more concretely. In the case of persongroups, each concept
on the first level of the body is a person and member of the
group. %See figure~\ref{fig:persongroup-example} for sample entries.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Others}
\label{sec:other-index-entry}
Only one index entry is very unusual and does not fit in any of the
proposed groups. It is the entry \textit{Saarbrücken, Gliederung},
which shows an overview over the \textit{Saarbrücken} entry (see
Figure~\ref{fig:sb-gliederung}). The \textit{Saarbrücken} entry is the
largest index entry with almost 100 pages. It is therefore split up
into seven entries. \textit{Saarbrücken, Gliederung} gives an overview
over these entries.

\subsection{XML Schema for the Index}
\label{sec:index-schema}
One of the main contributions of the Sbr-Regesten project was to
create an XML schema for the Sbr-Regesten. The schema can be found in
the file

\begin{verbatim}
sbr-regesten/regesten-schemas/sbr-regesten.xsd
\end{verbatim}

It was as far as it was applicable designed to comply with the
\href{http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/} {TEI
  Guidelines}\footnote{\href{http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/index.xml}{TEI
    P5}: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange by
  the TEI Consortium, Version 2.0.2, 2012}. This section describes the
schema for the index.

The index consists of an \texttt{index-info}, which contains general
information about the index, followed by an unrestricted number of
\texttt{items}. Each \texttt{item} represents an index entry and is
either a location, a person, a landmark, a family or a persongroup.
The schema covers each of the groups respectively.

Each index item requires the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{id}: a unique id (e.g. item\_381)
\item \texttt{type}: location, landmark, person, family or persongroup
\item \texttt{value}: the name of the item (printed in bold in the
  printed Sbr-Regesten)
\end{itemize}

An index \texttt{item} consists of an \texttt{item-header} and does
usually also have an \texttt{item-body}. Both are abstract elements,
which are substituted by the respective header and body types. This
decision was made in order to have only one type of items with
consecutive IDs, although the headers and bodies highly vary depending
on their type.

Irrespective its type, a header usually ends with the element
\texttt{mentioned-in}, which might only be followed by
\texttt{index-refs}. \texttt{mentioned-in} is of type
\texttt{mentionings} and contains a sequence of references to the
regests (\texttt{reg-ref}). The attribute \texttt{regest} specifies
the id from the regest it refers to. \texttt{index-refs} contains a
sequence of references to other index entries (\texttt{index-ref}).
The attribute \texttt{itemid} contains the id from the index item it
refers to.

The next sections will describe in more detail the elements that items
have depending on their type. They will also provide a XML example for
each header and body type.

\subsubsection{Headers}
\label{header-xml}

\paragraph{Location-Header}
\label{sec:location-header}
Figure~\ref{fig:location-header-xml} and \ref{fig:location-wuest-xml}
show examples for location headers. Location headers contain the
element \texttt{placeName}, which corresponds mostly to TEI's
\texttt{placeName}. Figure~\ref{fig:placeName} shows an example for a
comparison of the two. The Sbr-Regesten schema adopts TEI's
\texttt{settlement}, \texttt{district}, \texttt{region} and
\texttt{country}. It introduces two new attributes for the
\texttt{settlement} element, aside from \texttt{type}. It gets the
additional attributes \texttt{abandoned-village} and \texttt{av-ref}
to encode information about abandoned villages (\textit{Wüstungen}).
\texttt{abandoned-village} is an obligatory attribute, which denotes
whether the settlement is an abandoned village. If that is the case,
the optional attribute \texttt{av-ref} encodes a reference to the
catalogue of Staerk\footnote{Dieter Staerk, Die Wüstungen des
  Saarlandes, Minerva-Verlag, Saarbrücken, 1974.}. Region types may be
\texttt{Bundesland} (if located in Germany), \texttt{Departement}
(France) or \texttt{Province} (Belgium). \texttt{country} has no
attributes. The TEI guidelines define a \texttt{district} as “any kind
of subdivision of a settlement, such as a parish, ward, or other
administrative or geographic unit.”\footnote{TEI P5: Guidelines for
  Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange by the TEI Consortium,
  Version 2.0.2, 2012} In contrast, in our index-locations a
\texttt{district} is any administrative unit below a \texttt{region}
(\textit{Kreis, Gemeinde, Stadtverband}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{verbatim}
<placeName>
    <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>,
    <region type="state">New York</region>
</placeName>

<placeName>

    <region type="Bundesland">SL</region>
</placeName>
\end{verbatim}
\caption{\texttt{placeName} in TEI vs. \texttt{placeName} in the
  Sbr-Regesten schema}
\label{fig:placeName}
\end{figure}

Additional to \texttt{placeName}, the index schema for locations
introduces two elements: \texttt{addNames} and
\texttt{reference-point}. \texttt{addNames} contains a list of
additional names of the location, each of them tagged as
\texttt{addName}. \texttt{reference-point} includes further
information that is not covered by \texttt{district, region} or
\texttt{country}. It specifies closer where to find the location, e.g.
\textit{Im Köllertal, bei St. Ingbert} (\textit{in the Köllertal, near
  St. Ingbert}). All elements in \texttt{placeName} are optional (even
settlement, as \texttt{placeName} also occurs in family headers, where
locations are given, without their names being explicitly specified.)

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{verbatim}

\label{fig:location-wuest-xml}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Landmark-Header}
Figure~\ref{fig:landmark-header-xml} shows an example for a
\texttt{landmark-header}. Landmark-headers consist of the elements
\texttt{geogName}, \texttt{mentioned-in} and \texttt{index-refs}. The
element \texttt{geogName} captures the same concept as TEI's
\texttt{geogName}. But it is differently realized. Namely, it contains
exactly the two elements \texttt{name} and \texttt{addNames}
(additional names).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{verbatim}
<landmark-header>
   <geogName type="Fluss">
      <name>Rossel</name>
         <addNames>(
         <addName>Russel</addName>)
      /addNames>
   </geogName>, Fluss
</landmark-header>
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Sample for \texttt{landmark-header}}
\label{fig:landmark-header-xml}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Person-Header}
\label{sec:person-header}
Figure~\ref{fig:person-header-xml} shows an example for a
\texttt{person-header}. Person headers provide the element
\texttt{person}. Person consists of \texttt{persName} and
\texttt{description}. \texttt{persName} is very close to TEI's
\texttt{persName}. It contains (optional) \texttt{forename},
\texttt{surname}, \texttt{genName} (generational name, such as
\textit{Senior, the first, II.}, see TEI Guidelines) and
\texttt{roleName} (name of the role or official position of the
person, such as \textit{Fürst, Herzog, Papst}, see TEI Guidelines.).
The only addition to TEI in \texttt{persName} is \texttt{maidenname}
(maiden name). Also here we do not have a single additional name
(\texttt{addName}), but the element \texttt{addNames}, which contains
a list of \texttt{addName} elements. It is also important to know that
a \texttt{person} has not only an item id (as the other headers do),
but also an id that refers to the person itself. This is due to the
fact, that the \texttt{person} element is also used in the
\texttt{listing-body}. A person therefore has two attributes:
\texttt{id} and \texttt{itemid}. The other element of \texttt{person},
\texttt{description}, provides additional information about the
person, such as occupation, relation to other persons (\textit{married
  to, son of,} etc.). It is of type \texttt{content}, which means,
that it can contain \texttt{quote} elements, if there is original text
in the \texttt{description}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{verbatim}
<person-header>
   <person id="person_412">

\end{verbatim}

\label{fig:person-header-xml}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Family-Header}
Figure~\ref{fig:family-header-xml} displays an example for a
\texttt{family-header}. Family headers consist of the elements
\texttt{family-name}, \texttt{location}, \texttt{mentioned-in} and
\texttt{index-refs}. \texttt{family-name} consists of name and
\texttt{addNames} (additional names). \texttt{location} is of type
\texttt{placeName}, which is the same type that
\texttt{location-headers} have. See Section \ref{sec:location-header}
\textit{location-header} for more details.

\end{verbatim}
\caption{Sample for \texttt{family-header}}
\label{fig:family-header-xml}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Persongroup-Header}
Figure~\ref{fig:persongroup-header-xml} shows an example for a
\texttt{persongroup-header}. Persongroup headers consist of the
elements \texttt{group-name}, \texttt{mentioned-in} and
\texttt{index-refs}. \texttt{group-name} contains the name of the
persongroup.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{verbatim}
<persongroup-header>
   <group-name>Notare </group-name>
</persongroup-header>
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Sample for \texttt{persongroup-header}}
\label{fig:persongroup-header-xml}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Bodies}
There are two different types of bodies: \texttt{concept-body} and
\texttt{listing-body}.

\paragraph{Concept-body}
A concept-body contains the element \texttt{related-concepts}.
\texttt{related-concepts}, in turn, consists of an unrestricted number
of \texttt{concepts} and \texttt{persons}\footnote{Note, that
  currently only concepts are extracted.}. A concept provides a
\texttt{name}, a \texttt{description} and \texttt{mentioned-in}.
\texttt{name} contains the name of the concept and
\texttt{description} any additional information provided.
Additionally, a \texttt{concept} can recursively contain an element
\texttt{related-concepts}. For the description of a \texttt{person},
see Section \ref{sec:person-header} \textit{Person-Header}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{verbatim}

   </related-concepts>
</concept-body>
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Sample for \texttt{concept-body}}
\label{fig:concept-body-xml}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Listing-body}
Figure~\ref{fig:listing-body-xml} illustrates an example for a
\texttt{listing-body}. A listing-body consists of the element
\texttt{members}. \texttt{members} consists of a sequence of
\texttt{persons}, which have the type as the persons appearing in a
\texttt{person-header} (see Section sec:person-header
\textit{Person-Header}). Each \texttt{person} can have a
\texttt{related-concepts} element, which recursively can contain
related concepts again, as in a concept-body. That means, that in a
\texttt{persongroup} or \texttt{family}, the first layer displays
members of that family or group. The concepts on deeper levels might
also be family or group members but not obligatory. Therefore they are
not modeled as members on their own, but as related-concepts of that
member.

\subsection{Index Extraction}
In order to convert the Sbr-Regesten index into an XML representation,
relevant pieces of information have to be extracted from the HTML file
and tagged according to the schema. Additionally, the index entries
are written into the database \texttt{sbr-regesten.db}. This chapter
will describe in more detail how the XML for the index is extracted.
Generally, the index suffers many inconsistencies due to its manual
construction. That complicates the index extraction.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/index-extractor}
  \caption{Simplified architecture of \texttt{index\_extractor.py}}
  \label{fig:index-extractor}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:index-extractor} shows the basic architecture of the
module (\texttt{index\_extractor.py}), which is responsible for the
index extraction. Note that it does not show any classes, but is aimed
to illustrate the logical structure/work-flow of
\texttt{index\_extractor.py} to demonstrate its functionality. In
short, the \texttt{index\_extractor} module finds the index in the
HTML and extracts single index items. These are post-processed before
yielding the final XML for the index entries and writing them form the
XML file into the database.

The \texttt{index\_extractor.py} module is divided into three modules,
all of which are stored in the directory
\texttt{sbr-regesten/extraction/index\_utils}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{index\_to\_xml.py} extracts the index from the HTML file
  and converts it into an almost complete XML
\item \texttt{index\_xml\_postprocess.py} post-processes the XML
  solving the references to other index entries
\item \texttt{index\_to\_db.py} extracts the index items from the XML
  and writes them into the database
\end{itemize}

The index extraction is implemented in two separate stages which
convert the index into XML and store it in the database, respectively.
This has two reasons: it structures the module and it allows a manual
correction of the extracted XML before the items are added to the
database.

\subsubsection{Extracting, Classifying and Parsing Index Items}
The module \texttt{index\_to\_xml.py} uses the python package
\href{http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/}
{\textit{BeautifulSoup}} to process the HTML file and convert it into
its XML representation. One problem that arose was that due to the
maximum recursion limit the very deep structured index entry
\textit{Saarbrücken, Burgsiedlung/Dorf/Stadt} could not be processed.
Therefore the recursion limit had to be increased\footnote{This seems
  to be a common problem when using BeautifulSoup. See this
  \href{http://blog.pablohoffman.com/maximum-recursion-limit-in-python}{blog
    entry on maximum-recursion-limit-in-python}.}.

Figure~\ref{fig:index-to-xml} shows the call graph for the main
function of \texttt{index\_to\_xml.py}. It is pruned excluding the
preprocessing steps and the solving of underspecified index items (see
Section \ref{sec:classifier} \textit{ItemClassifier}).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.37]{img/index-to-xml}
  \caption{Pruned call graph of \texttt{index\_to\_xml.py}}.
  \label{fig:index-to-xml}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{ItemExtractor}
The ItemExtractor (implemented by the function
\texttt{extract\_items}) reads the HTML source and converts it into a
\texttt{BeautifulSoup} instance. The detection of the individual index
items is very straightforward, as the HTML provides tags for
paragraphs (\texttt{<p>}). Each index item is a paragraph. In order to
find the beginning of the index, the paragraph starting with the
keyword \textit{Index} is searched. Once it is found, the
ItemExtractor tags the next non-empty paragraph as
\texttt{<index-info>}. Each of the following non-empty paragraphs is
recognized as index \texttt{item}. It obtains an id and is
preprocessed. The preprocessing step deletes tags that are irrelevant
from the HTML and overcomes some irregularities. An instance of
\texttt{Index Item} is created, which divides the HTML paragraph into
a header and body. The ItemExtractor finishes processing the
paragraphs when reading more than ten empty paragraphs in a row. In
that case the index section is assumed to be finished. The end of the
index can not be identified directly via a keyword as for the
beginning of the index and as in the extraction of the other parts of
the books because the index is the last part of the book, only
followed by the footnotes (in the HTML file). Finally, all extracted
item objects are stored in a list and are in the next step given to
the ItemClassifier.

\paragraph{ItemClassifier}
\label{sec:classifier}
The ItemClassifier is implemented by the function
\texttt{classify\_and\_parse}. It classifies the items and forwards
them to their corresponding parser functions for processing. The
ItemClassifier obtains the list of index items and searches the header
of each item for a set of keys and regular expressions. These were
retrieved by a manual bootstrapping process and are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:regex} \footnote{Note, that the order of the keys and
  the matches are relevant, as some are more reliable than others.}.
According to the keys, the ItemClassifier decides for each item
whether it belongs to the group \textit{location, landmark, person,
  family, persongroup} or \textit{siehe}. It forwards the item to the
corresponding parser (\texttt{loc\_to\_XML, land\_to\_XML,
  pers\_to\_XML, fam\_to\_XML} or \texttt{persgr\_to\_XML}
respectively). The items stored in the \textit{siehe} list contain no
direct information about the group they belong to. But they contain
references to other index entries. Assuming that referring and
referenced entry have the same type, they are forwarded to the
corresponding parser after having solved the reference. Items that do
not contain any of the keywords are stored in the list
\textit{unclassified} and are not further processed. This is the case
for the entry \textit{Saarbrücken, Gliederung} as this is a rather
unusual entry (see Section~\ref{sec:other-index-entry}).

\paragraph{ItemParser}
When an item is classified it is passed to its corresponding
ItemParser. There is an ItemParser for each of the five groups. It
forwards the header to the specific header parser of its group and the
body to one of the two body parsers. It then adds the parsed item to
an itemList. The HeaderParsers return also the name of the index
entry, which is taken as \texttt{value} attribute of \texttt{item}.
For example, the LocationParser passes the header to the
Location-Header-Parser, which returns an XML \texttt{location-header}
and the name of the item. This name is taken as \texttt{value}
attribute. The id obtained by the ItemExtractor is taken as
\texttt{id} attribute and the \texttt{type} (in this case
\texttt{location}) is added. The body is passed to the
Concept-Body-Parser. The LandmarkParser, PersonParser, FamilyParser
and PersongroupParser proceed analogously. The following two sections
describe the parsers for the headers and the bodies.


\subsubsection{Header Parsers}
This section describes the five parser functions for the different
item headers: \textit{Location-Header-Parser, Landmark-Header-Parser,
  Person-Header-Parser, Family-Header-Parser} and
\textit{Persongroup-Header-Parser}. Functionalities that are used by
several parsers are presented at the end of this section: references
to the index, references to the regest and parsing of additional
names.

\paragraph{Location-Header-Parser}
The parser for the location headers (\texttt{loc\_header\_to\_XML})
builds a \texttt{<location-header>}, which contains a
\texttt{<placeName>}, which again includes a \texttt{<settlement>}.
The latter gets the attributes \texttt{abandoned-village} and
\texttt{av-ref}. The parser searches the header for the keyword
\textit{W.stung} in order to decide whether the location is an
abandoned village and assigns \texttt{abandoned village} the
corresponding value (\texttt{true/false}). The regular expression

\begin{verbatim}
Staerk, W.stungen Nr. [0-9]{1,2}
\end{verbatim}

is used to extract the reference to Staerk's catalogue\footnote{Dieter
  Staerk, Die Wüstungen des Saarlandes, Minerva-Verlag, Saarbrücken,
  1974.} \texttt{av-ref}. The name of the location is extracted from
the HTML via the \texttt{<b>} tag and added to the
\texttt{<settlement>} tag. The additional names are parsed by the
AddNamesParser (see Section \ref{sec:addNames} \textit{Parsing of
  Additional Names}) exploiting existing parenthesis and \texttt{<i>}
tags. From the rest of the HTML location-header, all HTML tags are
deleted before the rest is processed. Then references to the regests
and to other index entries are parsed by the respective parsing
functions (see Section~\ref{sec:reg-refs} and \ref{sec:index-refs}).
The remaining string is searched for the type of the settlement (for
the whole list see Figure~\ref{fig:location-list}). If one of the
keywords is found it is taken as value for the attribute \texttt{type}
of \texttt{settlement}. The rest of the string is parsed by the
function \texttt{parse\_place\_name} (see Section~\ref{sec:addNames}).
Afterwards, the placeNameTag is added to the location-header, as well
as the references to the regests and the references to the index. The
header is now parsed.

\paragraph{Landmark-Header-Parser}
The function \texttt{land\_to\_XML} implements the parser for landmark
headers. It builds a \texttt{BeautifulSoup} instance
\texttt{<landmark-header>} and adds a \texttt{<geogName>} tag to it.
The landmark's name is extracted via the \texttt{<b>} tags in the HTML
and added to a \texttt{<name>} tag, which is appended to
\texttt{geogName}. The remaining HTML is passed to the AddNameParser
in order to extract additional names, possibly appearing in the
beginning. The remaining part is flattened to a string, whose end is
searched for index-refs and mentionings. The remaining middle part is
thereafter searched for a set of keys for the type of landmark. See
Figure~\ref{fig:location-list}. If none of the keys is found in the
rest string, the name of the landmark is searched. This is because the
type is often not explicitly specified if it is already contained in
the name, e.g. \textit{Dirminger Tal, Ensdorfer Au}.

\paragraph{Person-Header-Parser}
The function \texttt{pers\_header\_to\_XML} parses person headers. It
builds a \texttt{<person-header>} \texttt{BeautifulSoup} tag and adds
a \texttt{<person>} tag to it. The latter obtains a continuous id with
the pattern \texttt{person\_[0-9]+}. A tag \texttt{<persName>} is
added to the \texttt{person}. The \texttt{name} is extracted
exploiting the \texttt{<b>} tags of the HTML. Thereafter, the HTML
tags are aborted and index-refs and mentionings are extracted from the
end of the remaining string (see Section~\ref{sec:index-refs} and
\ref{sec:reg-refs}). The remaining middle part is then used to extract
\texttt{forename, surname, genName and roleName}. For that purpose, a
set of keywords is exploited (e.g. \textit{der Dritte, der Junge, Jr}
for \texttt{genName} and \textit{Kaiser, Herzogin, Graf} for
\texttt{roleName}). A list of forenames is provided by the file
\texttt{sbr-regesten/resources/forenames.txt} which is imported at the
beginning of \texttt{index\_to\_xml.py} and augmented during the
extraction by the Listing-Body-Parser. A set of regular expressions
describes possible combinations of these different names. The first
matching rule is chosen and the item header tagged accordingly. The
remaining part of the string is tagged as \texttt{<description>}. At
the end the extracted index-refs and mentionings are added to the
\texttt{<person-header>} tag.

\paragraph{Family-Header-Parser}
The function \texttt{fam\_header\_to\_XML} parses headers of family
items. A \texttt{<family-header>} tag is created and a tag
\texttt{<family-name>} is appended to it. The latter contains the name
of the family extracted from the HTML via the \texttt{<b>} tags.
Afterwards, the \texttt{<b>} tag is deleted and the rest of the HTML
is searched for additional names. The rest of the HTML that does not
contain any additional names is converted into a tag-less string. If
this contains an opening parenthesis before the next word, the content
of these parenthesis are detected to be a location, which is parsed by
the placeName Parser (see Section~\ref{sec:addNames}), which also
parses the corresponding part from the location headers. The part
following the parenthesis (if there were such, elsewise, the whole
remaining string) is searched for index-refs and mentionings.

\paragraph{Persongroup-Header-Parser}
The Parser for persongroup-headers is the least complex headerParser,
due to the simplicity of the actual headers and the XML schema. A
\texttt{<persongroup-header>} tag is created. The HTML-tags are
deleted and index-refs and mentionings are found at the end of the
string. The remaining part is tagged as \texttt{<group-name>}.
\texttt{group-name, index-refs} and \texttt{mentionings} are added to
\texttt{persongroup-header}.

\paragraph{References to the Index}
\label{sec:index-refs}
References to the index can be found at the very end of an index entry
(regardless its type). They start with the keywords \textit{siehe} or
\textit{siehe auch}, e.g. \textit{siehe Lenterdingen, Volkersweiler}.
The function \texttt{find\_index\_refs} therefore recognizes strings
starting with one of these keyword and ending with the end of the
string as index-refs. As the references can not be solved at the time
of extracting the index (references can refer to future index
entries), they are not further processed, but only tagged with
\texttt{<index-refs>}. The further division into the individual index
references and their solving does not take place until the
post-processing step (see Section~\ref{sec:postproc}).

\paragraph{References to the Regests}
\label{sec:reg-refs}
The references to the regests are given by the date of the regest,
e.g. \textit{1377-03-08 (nach), 1065-04-03, 1277-07-02 (b)}. The are
not exactly the same as the titles of the regests. They usually
contain only the date plus the information that is crucial for
disambiguation. But this does not seem to be very consistent. They may
occur at the end of \texttt{related-concepts}, and at the end of each
type of index-header, only possibly followed by references to the
index (\texttt{index-refs}). The function \texttt{parse\_mentionings}
recognizes the references to the regests in a given string (by using a
regular expression). It builds a \texttt{<mentioned-in>} tag. It
starts form the end of the string and tries to find one reference
after another. It tags it as \texttt{<reg-ref>} and adds as attribute
\texttt{regest} the id of the regest it refers to. This part is
carried out by the function \texttt{get\_regest\_ID}. Once the
precedent part was not recognized as reference,
\texttt{parse\_mentionings} finishes.

\paragraph{Parsing of Additional Names \texttt{(parse\_addnames)}}
\label{sec:addNames}
\texttt{parse\_addnames} obtains a flat HTML element and extracts
additional names. Additional names are written in italics and in
parenthesis. Therefore the parser looks for \texttt{<i>} tags
surrounded by parenthesis. The string inside contains the additional
names, which are separated by commas. Each is tagged with
\texttt{<addName>} and added to a \texttt{<addNames>} tag.


\subsubsection{Body Parsers}
This section describes the two parser functions for index bodies
\textit{Concept-Body-Parser} and \textit{Listing-Body-Parser}.

\paragraph{Concept-Body-Parser}
\label{sec:conc-body-parser}
The function \texttt{conc\_body\_to\_XML} implements the
Concept-Body-Parser. It splits the HTML item into lines, making use of
the \texttt{<br>} tags. It created a \texttt{<concept-body>} tag,
which contains \texttt{<related-concepts>} tag. Each non-indented HTML
line is a \texttt{concept} and added to \texttt{<related-concepts>}.
It is split into \texttt{name}, \texttt{description} and
\texttt{mentionings}. \texttt{mentionings} are extracted according to
paragraph \ref{sec:reg-refs} \textit{References to the regests}. The
remaining string is split at the first comma. The first part of the
string will be the \texttt{name} of the concept and the second its
\texttt{description}. The indented lines below a concept are added to
a \texttt{related-concepts}. \texttt{related-concepts} again is split
into concepts and processes recursively. \texttt{<name>},
\texttt{<description>}, \texttt{<mentionings>} and
\texttt{<related-concepts>} are added to the \texttt{<concept>} tag.

\paragraph{Listing-Body-Parser}
The function \texttt{listing\_body\_to\_XML} implements the parser for
listing bodies. It builds a \texttt{<listing-body>} tag, which again
contains a \texttt{<members>} tag. The Listing-Body-Parser splits the
item HTML in lines exploiting the \texttt{<br>} tags. Each
non-indented line is a person. A \texttt{<person>} tag is created
which contains a \texttt{<persName>} tag. In almost all cases, the
string of the person starts with its forename (especially in
family-headers, where the surname is already given in the header). The
Listing-Body-Parser therefore tags the first word in the person as
\texttt{<forename>} and adds it to the \texttt{<persName>} tag. These
forenames are additionally used to extend the forenames list (which is
provided by \texttt{sbr-regesten/resources/forenames.txt} and used to
find forenames in person headers). From the remaining string
additional names (\texttt{addNames}) are parsed and added to
\texttt{<persName>}. \texttt{<mentionings>} are extracted as described
in Section~\ref{sec:reg-refs} \textit{References to regests}). The
remaining part is tagged as \texttt{<description>}. The indented lines
below a person-line are \texttt{related-concepts} of that person. The
latter are parsed recursively using the same process as described in
the paragraph above(\ref{sec:conc-body-parser}). \texttt{<persName>},
\texttt{<description>}, \texttt{<mentionings>} and
\texttt{<related-concepts>} are added to the \texttt{<person>} tag.

\subsubsection{Post-Processing}

\paragraph{ItemPostprocessor}
\label{sec:postproc}
The post-processing step solves the references to other in index
entries. This is only possible when the entire index is already
parsed, as it searches all index items. The post-processing step is
carried out by the module \texttt{index\_xml\_postprocess.py}. It
takes the temporary file \texttt{index.xml} as input, which was
produced by the module \texttt{index\_to\_xml.py} and deletes it
afterwards. It builds a \texttt{BeautifulSoup} instance out of the
index XML, which is split into single index items. It detects the yet
unsolved \texttt{<reg-refs>} tags and splits the contained string into
the single references (using comma as separator). The references are
solved by matching the string to the \texttt{value} of each index
item. If the reference can be solved, a \texttt{<reg-ref>} tag is
added to \texttt{<reg-refs>}. The id of the referred index item is
stored in the attribute \texttt{regest}. Finally, the parsed index is
added to \texttt{sbr-regesten/sbr-regesten.xml}.

\subsubsection{Writing the Index into the Database}
\texttt{index\_to\_db.py} takes the \texttt{sbr-regesten.xml} as input
and processes the index items. It creates an entry in the database,
extracts the tags from the item and adds the information to the fields
defined in the model (see Section~\ref{sec:data-model}).

\subsubsection{Future Work}
This section presents possible next steps for extending the XML schema
for the index, extraction process and possible further uses. Depending
on future demands, different extensions will have priority.
Section~\ref{sec:git} describes how to obtain a copy of the source
code. After modifying the Sbr-Regesten schema or the extraction
process, an XML Schema \emph{Validator}, as the
\href{http://corefiling.com/opensource/schemaValidate.html}
{CoreFiling XML Schema Validator}, can (and should) be used to
validate the XML output against the schema.

\paragraph{References to the Regests}
At the time of developing the index extraction, the regest part of the
book was not yet extracted or written into the database. Once this is
the case, the first expansion of the current code would be to solve
the references to the regests. The references are already recognized
and tagged with \texttt{reg-ref}. Each \texttt{<reg-ref>} is supposed
to store the id of the regest it refers to in the attribute
\texttt{regest}. This is not yet the case. The function
\texttt{get\_regest\_ID} always returns the dummy id regest\_99999. We
would recommend to re-implement the function \texttt{get\_regest\_ID}
in

\begin{verbatim}
sbr-regesten/extraction/index\_utils/index\_to\_xml.py
\end{verbatim}

The references can be solved by searching the database, as the regests
are added to the database before \texttt{index\_to\_xml.py} is called.
To include the references also in the database, the function
\texttt{ment\_to\_db} in
\texttt{sbr-regesten/extraction/index\_utils/index\_to\_db.py} has to
be implemented.

\paragraph{Extracting Person Names}
The user can provide a list of forenames, which is used to extract the
names of \texttt{person} items. The forenames have to be stored in the
file

\begin{verbatim}
sbr-regesten/resources/forenames.txt
\end{verbatim}

During the extraction of the index it uses this list to recognize
forenames and expands it at the same time. Newly amended names are
only considered from the point on they were added. This could be
overcome by proceeding similar to the solving of references to other
index items (see Section~\ref{sec:index-refs}). In the extraction step
persons would be recognized and parsed as such. At the same time the
list of forenames would be augmented. In the post-processing step all
extracted forenames could be used to parse the names. Additionally, a
similar process could be conceivable for surnames, role names and
generative names.

\paragraph{Quotes}
The HTML source provides information about which parts of the text are
original text. Such sections are marked with italics (\texttt{<i>}).
To mark original text the Sbr-Regesten schema introduces the element
\texttt{quote}. This is mainly used in the regests. In the index,
quotes are extracted from the description part of the bodies. The tag
\texttt{<addNames>} implicitly encodes this information as they
extract text in italics. Otherwise this information gets lost during
the process of extraction. But we can imagine the usefulness of
conserving information about original text also in other parts of the
index, we propose to expand the schema to allow quotes.

\paragraph{Expand References to the Index}
References to other index entries are only found and solved if they
appear in the header right after the mentionings. But such references
can also appear in the bodies or in other parts of the headers, e.g.
in location-headers before the district. The schema could be adapted
to allow \texttt{reg-refs} there as well. They would have to be tagged
by \texttt{index\_to\_xml.py} and would then (automatically) be
extracted by the existing the \texttt{parse\_siehe} function in
\texttt{index\_xml\_postprocess}.

\paragraph{Recognize Persons in the Bodies}
Index item bodies often contain many persons which could be extracted
using the \texttt{person} element defined in the Sbr-Regesten schema.
The most prominent case, of course, are the bodies of families and
persongroups. The current extraction process extracts persons at the
outermost level of listing-bodies. But persons do also appear on
deeper levels of listing-bodies or in concept bodies. These persons
are currently parsed as \texttt{concepts}. The schema allows such
extension, as it allows \texttt{persons} in the
\texttt{related-concept} element.

\begin{verbatim}
  <xs:complexType name="related-concepts" mixed="true">
    <xs:choice maxOccurs="unbounded">
      <xs:element name="concept" type="concept" />
      <xs:element name="person" type="person" />
    </xs:choice>
  </xs:complexType>
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Semantic Network}
The regests and the index do not only provide information about
entities, but also about the relations among them. This becomes
evident especially in the case of persons. The index provides
information such as \textit{married with} or \textit{son of}. This
explicit information could be extracted to build networks of relations
between persons or other entities. Also, we can imagine to extract
such relations directly from the regests. The relations could build
the basis for semantic queries and easy visualization of entity
relations.
